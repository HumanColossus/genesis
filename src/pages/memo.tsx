            the vast majority will continue to be underserved and unguided â€” self-teaching is difficult. Itâ€™s time to treat self-paced, self-motivated education
            as the true alternative it is, and build the infrastructure students need.

            Itâ€™s not for lack of effort. Itâ€™s not for lack of time. Itâ€™s not for lack of free learning resources. Instead, there are three major reasons why
            young people have struggle gaining momentum:

          <h1 className={header}>Guidance</h1>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ Itâ€™s hard to know where/how to start.</p>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ Itâ€™s hard to not get stuck or lost along the way.</p>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ Itâ€™s hard to stay on track and maintain long-term vision for what youâ€™re doing.</p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            Itâ€™s easy to forget <span className="bg-[#30267c]">how easy it is to get stuck when youâ€™re young</span>; knowing where to find answers to questions,
            finding alternatives, or overcoming obstacles is a skill that develops with age.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            Young people need a lot of help, which we can provide in broken-down guides, direction from mentors, and the space to continuously expand into
            increasingly ambitious endeavors.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            Most importantly, <span className="bg-[#30267c]">we donâ€™t need to create new educational content,</span>
            &#160; just direction on where to find existing resources. We donâ€™t need to supplement the countless courses, videos, textbooks, and articles
            already out there, for free!
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            The minority of content produced by Colossus members will be what they would have created already, in the form of project releases and articles,
            modified to fit the platform (steps for replication, learning pre-requisites, etc.).

          <h1 className={header}>Tangibility</h1>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ It&apos;s hard if your progress doesn&lsquo;t show results or feel rewarding.</p>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ It&apos;s hard if learning has little or infrequent real-world, hands-on application. </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>ðŸš¨ It&apos;s hard if there isn&apos;t a strong reason &quot;why&quot; one is learning.</p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            Itâ€™s counterintuitive that resources, like KhanAcademy, MIT OpenCourseware, or Libgen, are{" "}
            <span className={highlight}>not often cited by builders as paths for self-learning</span>, given that they provide limitless, free, world-class
            education.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>Why is this? Tangibility. </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            This is easy to see if we take a look at non-digital, advanced subjects. Naturally, contribution and acknowledgement in high-depth subjects is very
            discrete: there is little contribution that a high schooler can progressively create in the field of mathematics.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            As a result, studying high-depth topics can be incredibly difficult, as progress can feel useless and intangible.{" "}
            <span className={highlight}>Most people arenâ€™t capable of self-studying math for years in hope of a distant payoff</span>, especially since
            institutional education will not recognize it.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            This outlines tangibility, which is akin to <span className={highlight}>changing learning from climbing a cliff into walking up stairs</span>, where
            reward can be found at each step.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>
            In software, this is common: students begin with building a personal website, feel proud of their creation, then iterate.{" "}
            <span className={highlight}>Contribution, creation, and impact can be created within hours</span>: results are tangible, not abstract.
          </p>
          <p className={paragraph}>Whether itâ€™s web development, biology, or climate research, we can make progression more tangible.</p>

            A community of similarly-paced peers can offer the feedback, criticism, and appreciation to keep students moving. Through shared effort,
