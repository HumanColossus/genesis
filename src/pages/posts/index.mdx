         # Key metrics and their interaction (H1)

    How to properly measure a (blockchain) system is one of the least talked about but most significant steps in its design and evaluation. There are numerous consensus protocols and variations with various performance and scalability tradeoffs. But as of yet, there is still no universally agreed-upon, reliable method that enables apples-to-apples comparisons. In this blog post, we outline a method inspired by measurements in data-center systems and discuss common errors to avoid when evaluating a blockchain network.
