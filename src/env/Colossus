Our goal with Colossus is build infrastructure on top of builder communities and the self-taught experience. This requires us to build monopolistic functionality that keeps users using our platform. Ideas:

Isolate the process of getting help and advice to Colossus.

Isolate the process of sharing your creations with other builders.

Isolate the personal website and portfolio to one platform.

Furthermore, we want to create exclusive content and utility to builders around the world. This can be through passive content (videos, articles, curriculums), active cohorts, point systems, leaderboards, etc.

Plan:

Build product hunt clone.

Go contact builder communities and ask them what their users might be needing.
